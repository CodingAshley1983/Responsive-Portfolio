      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/5.24.18.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>I am a huge fan of music, music festivals and live shows.
        I've fronted a number of bands as a blues/jazz/soul vocalist. I play guitar, piano and ukulele,
        and this past summer I added "cigar-box" guitar to my instrumental repetoire when I built an electric guitar
        out of an 800 page book. I can't wait to make the next one!</p>
        <br><br>
      </p> I'm originally from Upstate NY (nowhere near NYC!) and moved to Denver in 2011. I've taken an unintentional hiatus
      from the music scene and focused on writing my own at home. I occasionally find time to jam with other
      musicians and it makes my soul happy. I currently work as an Educational admin/project manager
      with an incredible, national association for massage therapy</p>

      <p>I work really closely with our IS department and am so looking forward to 
      becoming a web developer and moving into their department.<br>
      Here's to a successful 6-month program and an amazing new career!</p>
