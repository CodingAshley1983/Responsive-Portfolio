      <p>I've spent years helping others heal as a Licensed Massage Therapist, got bodies moving on the dance floor as a vocalist/musician, and now 
        I'm getting my hands into web development. I'm bringing my analytically creative brain to the table to design web applications 
        to meet various client needs.
      </p>I currently work as an Educational admin/project manager
      with an incredible, national association for massage therapy</p>

      <p>I work really closely with our IS department and am so looking forward to 
      becoming a web developer and moving into their department.<br>
